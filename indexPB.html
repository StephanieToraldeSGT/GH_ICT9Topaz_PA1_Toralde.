        let p3 = '* Then, the next chapter of its evolution happened when its name was later edited to LiveScript because of how the program could be changed and edited in real-time.'
        let p4 = '* Later on, they decided that it be best for marketing reasons to merge the name LiveScript with Java, which is where we get the popular name for the programming language; "JavaScript".'
        let p5 = '* The truest debut of JavaScript 1.0 itself, was with its release with NetScape Navigator 2.0, as both were key innovations for the Document Object Model (DOM)'
        let p6 = '* Finally, in order to prevent a broken browser environment, Netscape gave up JavaScript (alongside Microsofts JScript) to ECMA International. Making Javascript a ECMA-262 standard in 1997 as both it and JScript became dialects for ECMAScript, which could be considered another name for the programming language of JavaScript (I think, I dunno I forgot..)'
